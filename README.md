# Self-Driving-Car-System-Using-Raspberry-Pi
This project aims to demonstrate how to build a basic autonomous vehicle using affordable and accessible hardware and software tools. By leveraging the power of the Raspberry Pi, various sensors, and advanced machine learning algorithms, this project provides a hands-on approach to understanding and developing self-driving car technologies.
# Objectives of the project
•	Develop a system capable of recognizing and categorizing various objects such as traffic signs, pedestrians, vehicles, and obstacles.
•	Implement software that can detect lane markings and guide the vehicle to follow a safe path on the road while maintaining a safe distance from other vehicles.
•	Create algorithms that enable the car to make real-time decisions based on environmental factors, such as traffic conditions, weather, and road obstacles.
•	Design a system to store and analyse data collected during test drives inorder to improve the car's performance and safety features.
•	Integrate sensors such as cameras, ultrasonic sensors, and LIDAR to provide comprehensive environmental awareness for the self-driving car system.
•	Implement fail-safe measures and redundancy systems to ensure the safety and reliability of the self-driving car.
